# faster-babel-image-archives
generates random images like the babel image archives but much faster\
\
The number of possible 640x480 images is approximately 10^<sup>2219213</sup> this means that if you generate 60 images a second it would take you around 3.8x10^<sup>2219194</sup> times more than the age of the universe to see them all\
\
The number of possible 8x8 images is a bit smaller at approximately 10^<sup>4623</sup> this means that if you generate 60 images per second it would take you about 3.8x10^<sup>444</sup> times more than the age of the universe to see them all\
\
you can alter the dimensions of the image and the speed at which it generates the images (60 frames per second to 1 frame per minute)
you can also toggle greyscale images
